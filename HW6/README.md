# Write a function named hasFinalLetter that takes two parameters 
- strList, a list of non-empty strings 
- letters, a string of upper and/or lower case letters
The function hasFinalLetter should create and return a list of all the strings in strList that end with a letter in letters.
> Create three test cases, each consisting of a list of non-empty strings and a string of upper and/or lower case letters, for your function in Problem 1a. One of these tests should return the empty list. For each test case write two assignment statements and a function call that pass the test arguments to your function.
 
# Write a function named isDivisible that takes two parameters
- maxInt, an integer
- twoInts, a tuple of two integers
The function isDivisible should create and return a list of all the ints in the range from 1 to maxInt (not including maxInt) that are divisible of both ints in twoInts.
> Create three test cases, each consisting of a value for maxInt and a value for twoInts, for your function in Problem 2a. One of these tests should return the empty list. For each test case write two assignment statements and a function call that pass the test arguments to your function.
