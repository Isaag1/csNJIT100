# Write a Python expression that creates a list named frequency, in which the elements are the number of times each of the letters A, B, C, D and F appear in grades. For example, for the above value of grades, the following would be correct output:
frequency = [4, 2, 2, 0, 2]
Your expression must give the correct values for any list of grades, not just the one in your list. Hint:
use the list method count.
# This question practices list membership, list indexes and list slices.
- Write a Python statement that creates a list named dog_breeds that contains the elements 'collie', 'sheepdog', 'Chow', and 'Chihuahua' in the order given.
- Write a Python statement that uses list slicing to create a list herding_dogs that is made up of the first two elements of dog_breeds.
- Write a Python statement that uses list indexing to create a list tiny_dogs that is made up of the last element of dog_breeds.
- Write a Python statement that tests whether 'Persian' is in the list dog_breeds and prints either True or False depending on the answer.
